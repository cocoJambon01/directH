Good night!

We released Selenide 4.6 

<br>

# Method `$.shouldHave(exactValue(" foo  "))` does not trim leading/trailing spaces anymore

As you probably know, method `$.shouldHave(value(" foo  "))` (which we all typically use) trims leading/trailing spaces in the given string.
It's convenient because web browsers also do so. But we recently found that method `exactValue()` also do it, and that's not right.

Assuming that you have `<textarea value="Regression test description "></textarea>` on a page,
the check `$("textarea").shouldHave(exactValue("Regression test description "));` failed before this release. Not it will not.

# We added method `$.getSearchCriteria()`

Selenide always had a convenient method `$.toString()` - it prints actual description of a web element: tag, text, attributes.
It's very useful for logging and debugging. Bit it has one drawback: it calls webdriver methods to get those data, 
which can be slow sometimes.

So we added method `$.getSearchCriteria()` that doesn't call any webdriver methods, but just returns a locator.

Simply said,


```java
  assertThat($("h2").toString(), equalTo("<h2>Dropdown list</h2>"));
  assertThat($("h2").getSearchCriteria(), equalTo("h2"));
```

# Fixed [issue 528](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/528)

Thanks to [@BorisOsipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for the [pull request](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/530)!


# Fixed [issue 484](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/484)

Sometimes Selenide could throw such an error without screenshot:

```java
Element not found {#valid-id.findBy(text 'INVALID-TEXT')}
Expected: text '9802222-99LX'

Screenshot: null
Timeout: 0 ms.
```

We fixed it.

# Fixed running IE on selenium grid

(OMG, does somebody still use IE and Grid in 21st century?)
